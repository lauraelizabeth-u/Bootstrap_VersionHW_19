  <h6>The Problem</h6>
    <p>
        People interested in live music have been relying on multiple apps and websites to try and find shows, venue information, and local artists.    
    </p>

  <h6>The Solution</h6>
    <p>
        We believe we can support the community and help users find local artists and venues by designing a platform that allows them to connect and find information.
    </p>

  <h6>Project Description</h6>
    <p>
        MUSICA is an app to help fans, local artists and small venues connect. It allows fans to easily find shows, artists, and venue information. And helps small businesses or artists advertise themselves.     
    </p>

  <h6>Empathize & Define</h6>
    <p>
        We started our research process by interviewing several possible users that fit our target audience. We wanted to empathize with them to define what was most important, and know what we had to prioritize. To begin to define our project we created a user persona and came up with our problem statement.    
    </p>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <h6>User Interviews</h6>
    <p>
        To make sure we got consistent results we created a  guide with an organized list of questions we brainstormed. Then, to keep track of all the data we created a transcript of the interviews.    
    </p>

    </div>

  <h6>Affinity Diagram</h6>
    <p>
        With the insights we got from the interviews we made our Affinity Diagram, organizing all related facts and insights. When we started to see patterns in the research, we divided them into the following four categories.    
    </p>

  <h6>User Persona</h6>
    <p>
        Using our collected data we came up with our persona, Mia Jones. She is a 24 year old single woman, who recently moved near Orlando. Mia loves attending live music events alone and with her friends, but has a hard time finding local artists and venues online, as she doesn’t live in the main downtown area.

    <h6>Value Proposition Canvas</h6>
    <p>
        We used the value proposition canvas to make sure we were centering our design for the user’s needs and values. As a team, we took time to analyze their struggles and what eased them, as well as their gains, and the jobs the customer would be responsible for.

  <h6>Ideate</h6>
    <p>
        With a good idea of our target audience’s needs and wants, we set out into our ideation phase. Here, we discussed several possible features and solutions we could include in our design.    
    </p>
</div>

<div class="container">
<h6>Mind Map</h6>
    <p>
        We decided to use a Mind Map to decide how to divide our content. Visualizing helped all of us keep track of one singular design using all of our ideas and opinions.

    <h6>Prototyping & Testing</h6>
      <p>
        Moving on to prototyping, we divided the pages amongst our teammembers. Afterwards, we itirated to combine our design into one smooth app. And finally began testing with potential users.       
    </p>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <h6>Mid-Fidelity Wireframe</h6>
      <p>
        To begin we threw together a quick low-fidelity wireframe to map out what our display was going to look like. Then, we set out separately to more thoroughly design our mid fidelity wireframes and brought them together to review them as a team.      
    </p>
      <div class="img-container">

      </div>

  <h6>User Testing</h6>
      <p>
        After smoothing over our individual designs into one cohesive one. We began running user tests on our prototype. Then, itirated changes and repeated the process until we were pleased with the outcome.
