  <h6>The Problem</h6>
    <p>
      Travel apps don’t provide enough information for users’ liking, so they’re often left dissatisfied and feeling unsafe, which results in a lower rate of returning customers.
    </p>

  <h6>The Solution</h6>
    <p>
      To improve the app by including virtual tours, safety guidelines and other details so users can make a more informed decision regarding their travel.
    </p>

  <h6>Project Description</h6>
    <p>
      Odysseia is a post covid travel app designed to help users plan their travels while staying on a budget and being mindful of cleanliness and Covid Guidelines.
    </p>

  <h6>Team Members:</h6>
    <p>
      Laura Isaac, Maria Telles, Leon Dinh, Ashley Stanford
    </p>

  <h6>Role:</h6>
    <p>
      UX & UI Designer
    </p>

  <h6>Tools:</h6>
    <p>
      Figma, Trello, Slack, Google Drive
    </p>

<div class="container2">
  <h6>Empathize & Define</h6>
    <p>
      As per the Design Thinking process, we began by empathizing with potential users hoping to understand their problems, concerns, gains, and goals, to help them as best as we can. Then, with the information we collected we set out to define what problem that the majority of users are facing we will target with our design.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <h6>User Interviews</h6>
    <p>
      To begin our process we designed an interview that covered user’s research, planning, and what they consider most important when planning a trip. Then, we put our script into practice with 5 people who fit our target audience.
    </p>

  <h6>Affinity Diagram</h6>
    <p>
      As we began to see patterns in our research we created an Affinity Diagram, organizing the related facts and insights into categories.
    </p>

  <h6>User Persona</h6>
    <p>
      Using our findings, we created a User Persona. Meet Alex Rivera, a young guy living in Miami, FL. He loves traveling, cooking and nature. When he travels, he wants to explore new cultures and meet new people, but since he’s trying to save up, one of his top priorities is staying on budget, as well as staying safe and healthy.

  <h6>Ideate</h6>
    <p>
      With a solid idea of our users and their needs, we were ready to start ideating. In our many discussions and meetings we used a few different brainstorming techniques to help us get as many ideas out as possible, without feeling too much pressure to make any of them perfect.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="container">
<h6>User Flow</h6>
    <p>
      We created a User Flow to roughly map out the main pages we would be designing, by following what would be a user’s natural flow through the app. This helped us plan out everything we needed to include and allowed us to begin our sketching and prototyping with a good idea in mind. Especially since we were working in a group, it was helpful to have visuals that kept us all on the same page throughout our design process.
    </p>

<div class="container2">
    <h6>Prototyping & Testing</h6>
      <p>
        Then, we began on our prototyping. Our team decided to split the pages between ourselves. Once those were assigned, we got started sketching and creating low-mid fidelity wireframes, checking in with each other every step of the way to make sure we had a cohesive design. Finally, we put our design to the test and did the necessary iterations.
      </p>
</div>

<div class="container">
  <h6>Mid-Fidelity Wireframe</h6>
      <p>
        Here’s what we got for our mid fidelity wireframes, after editing, iterating and the initial sketches. We included all the pages from our User Flow, and created some of the elements as components to make it easier to user throughout the design.
      </p>
      <div class="img-container">
        <img src="./images/midwiref.png" class="img-fluid2" alt="midfidelitywireframe">
      </div>

  <h6>User Testing</h6>
      <p>
        After conducting some user tests on our prototype we iterated the changes. By the end we were pleased with our project and our users all were able to complete the tasks with ease. Of course, next we would continue to create the high fidelity version… we’ll see.
